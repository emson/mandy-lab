Sorted Word Count
=================

Problem
-------
Following from the previous word count example, calculate occurrences of individual words from a given input set
ordering output in descending order.

Example
-------

Given an input of:

> ALICE was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
> sister on the bank and of having nothing to do: once ...

produce the following:

		of	2
		ALICE	1
		bank 1
		and	1
		...
		
(note alphabetical ordering of words is not significant)

Further example text (for input) is available in `./input/alice.txt or ./input/war.txt`
